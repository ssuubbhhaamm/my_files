BUCKETING IN HIVE
IT CAN DIVIDE THE DATA INTO GROUPS BASED ON THE CLUSTERING COLUMN AS BUCKETS.
BUCKET CAN BE USED WHERE PARTITIONING IS NOT POSSIBLE.

EMPNO

SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEES WHERE EMPNO IS BETWEEN 1 TO 100; --RANGE SEARCH

THE CONCEPT IF BUCKETING IS BASED ON THE HASHING TECHNIQUES.

BUCKETS ARE SUB DIRECTORIES CREATED BY HIVE, AND STORE THE RANGE OF THE DATA INTO RESPECTIVE SUB DIRECTORIES.


EXAMPLE

1. FIRST WE WILL CREATE A NORMAL TABLE AND THEN A BUCKETING TABLE AND TRANSFER THE NORMAL TABLE DATA INTO BUCKETING TABLE.

hive> create table emp(empno int,ename string,job string,mgr int,hiredate string,salary int,comm int,deptno int)
row format delimited
fields terminated by '/';

From Linux terminal
[root@saispark ~]# cd Desktop/
[root@saispark Desktop]# hdfs dfs -put emp.txt /user/hive/warehouse/emp/


hive> set hive.enforce.bucketing=true;


2. CREATING THE BUCKET TABLE

hive> create table emp_buckets(empno int,ename string,job string,mgr int,hiredate string,salary int,comm int,deptno int)
clustered by(empno) into 2 buckets
row format delimited
fields terminated by '/';

hive> insert overwrite table emp_buckets select * from emp;

$ hdfs dfs -ls /user/hive/warehouse/emp_buckets;

$ hdfs dfs -cat /user/hive/warehouse/emp_buckets/000000_0
